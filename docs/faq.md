### What about other Debian / Ubuntu based distributions? 

PiVPN may be able run and install VPN Protocols on any other Debian or Ubuntu based distributions however we do not provide support for them. 

### What about docker? 

Support for docker images is currently experimental and we do not provide any official images or official support. There is no ETA for full support. 

### What About Octopi?

As per [Github Issue #373 on Octpi](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/373) OctoPi doesn't play well with PiVPN installer as they use a git wrapper that blocks it from running as root user. To disable the git wrapper please do: `sudo rm /root/bin/git`

### Can I have Wireguard and OpenVPN at the same time? 

Yes! All you have to do is to run PiVPN installation again. PiVPN will ask you what intend to do and setup everything for you. After the installation is finished all you have to do is to use `pivpn wg [options]` and `pivpn ovpn [options]` to manage each protocol. 

```

## My ISP doesn't give me a static external IP address and my server IP address keeps changing!

You will need a dynamic DNS service and a hostname. If your IP address changes, your hostname will then automatically point to the new IP address. Some free dynamic DNS services are <http://noip.com>, <http://freedns.afraid.org/> or <https://www.duckdns.org/>.

### DynDns

Refer to: [https://help.dyn.com/ddclient/](https://help.dyn.com/ddclient/)

`apt-get install ddclient`

`/etc/ddclient.conf` example config:
```
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

ssl=yes
protocol=dyndns2
use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.com, web-skip='IP Address'
server=members.dyndns.org
login=username
password='password'
mydyn.domain.com
```

If you use a namecheap domain your ddclient setup can be found [here](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/583/11/how-do-i-configure-ddclient).

## Something isn't working?

Run `pivpn -d` and check the output.
